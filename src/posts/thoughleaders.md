I never really thought about this term,
but a thoughtleader is someone who leads your thoughts.
That means by following a thoughtleader you accept that your thinking is flawed,
that you need someone to take charge and guide you in the right direction.

Typical examples of thoughtleaders are priests and crypto-bros
--- I guess there is an interesting observation hidden somewhere.
