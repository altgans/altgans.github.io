# Creativity, Cognition and why I write







## Re: When is it better to think without words?

Thoughts about [When is better to think without words? - by Henrik Karlsson](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/wordless-thought)

The cover picture fits perfectly. A well written essay that touches all the important points. You can see that the author writes regularly.





> The hypothesis here is that if you work hard on a problem, you 
> soak your subconscious with it. Wrestling with a problem helps you build
>  a mental model of what you know and what you don’t—providing the 
> subconscious with building blocks to work with. (You can’t have genuine 
> intuition and inspiration in areas where you lack knowledge.) Then, once
>  you drop the problem from conscious thought and go take care of the 
> dishes or something, the subconscious begins a silent and parallelized 
> search, trying many, many alternatives (in a somewhat random fashion), 
> until something snaps in place. When this happens, the solution bubbles 
> back up to the conscious mind, as if out of *nowhere*, making you freeze mid-motion with a stack of dirty plates in your hands



How to build the mental model?

Maybe the author provides the best summary; "the relationship between verbal thinking and deep wordless concentration is complex".

Creativity and cognition.



## Learning by writing

An great idea for beginner-learning is to write a book about a topic while still being a beginner. Ask questions! 

This is how [Steve Klabnik](https://steveklabnik.github.io/jujutsu-tutorial/) creates his tutorials -- "You only get to look at a problem as a beginner once, and so I think writing this stuff down is interesting. It also helps meclarify what I'm learning to myself."

## Structing ideas

Structuring thoughts, structuring words, structuring folders and structuring ideas. All the same.

Original at [Designing better file organization around tags, not hierarchies](https://www.nayuki.io/page/designing-better-file-organization-around-tags-not-hierarchies)

How is this article relevant? Because the author tries to provide structure to the formless.

TODO describe why _I_ write

TODO for work, write summaries of ongoing topics (rollouts, problems, ...) to capture the core ideas and problems

TODO ask more questions -- why does something not work? why do we do things in a specific way?
