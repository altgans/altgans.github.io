Less of a guide and more of a dumping ground for ideas, todos and links

- Maybe change the shell? I use [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) (created by the same guy who also created [Calibre ❤️](https://calibre-ebook.com/)), but [ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) also looks promising.
- It may be yet another opportunity to set up [espanso](https://espanso.org/).
- [Fish](https://fishshell.com/)
	- [starhip](https://starship.rs/) shell
	- GPG keyring + SSH keys
- unified password sync, backup and file sharing
	- synology, borg, rsync
	- KeepassXC, bitwarden, 1password?
- better editor setup for blogging
	- nvim, lazynvim
	- Obsidian
- coding setup
	- manage environments with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [mise-en-place](https://mise.jdx.dev/)
	- VS Code, zed, emacs, kakoune, ... ?
- Other
	- [localsend](../localsend)
	- vlc, mpv
	- calibre
	- firefox!
	- Mixxx
	- Krita

## Network

- Tailscale to connect to my Synology NAS and to troubleshoot my family?
- [pihole](https://pi-hole.net/)

## Ricing

> [Yak-shaving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving)? [Motivation!](https://world.hey.com/dhh/beautiful-motivations-6fef7c73)

- Change my wallpaper
- Unify the system GUIs
	- GTK4?
- [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org/)
	- [DankMaterialShell](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell)
	- [Noctalia](https://docs.noctalia.dev/) :: has a better name than DankShell, will start with this
- Scrollable WM
	- Hypraland? :: I think this is too much of a _Gentoo uber-rice_ thing. I prefer simplicity and quiet
	- [Niri](../niri)
