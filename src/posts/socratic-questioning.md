> Believe me or don't, but I dreamt about this, and then someone told me this exists

The basic idea is to prepare questions instead of answers, and then give answers in a way how you would teach the content to someone else.

I felt the need to do so after business-meetings, where I needed to report what happened to my manager. Sure, I always take notes, but taking notes does not foster understanding. Instead, I write down questions I have and then try to answer them -- often I get stuck, or discover a new perspective.

Example: `We are going to do XYZ because...` vs. `Why are we going to do XYZ? What are the alternatives? Is XYZ truly the best approach? What has been tried before?`

Knowledge needs active recall, and only when I can explain the cause and reason to someone else can I claim that I truly understood.
