[Localsend](https://localsend.org/) is a very useful tool to allow sending files in my local network, between Windows, Linux, Android, .... It just works. Magic! Wow!

I learned about the tool when reading the [Omacom OS](https://learn.omacom.io/3/omacom) manual, which has a curated list of recommended applications.
