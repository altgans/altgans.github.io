This is yet another one of the situations where two of life's most important tenents clash: _never change a running system_ contra _never stop looking beyond_.

I sit and write this from my trusted pastel-pink [IKEA HATTEFJÃ„LL](https://www.ikea.com/de/de/p/hattefjaell-drehstuhl-mit-armlehnen-gunnared-beige-weiss-60538955/). (270 EUR).

However, when sitting in the office I noticed how comfy their chairs are -- [hjh Office Chefsessel VENUS BASE](https://www.buerostuhl-shop.de/Venus-Base/657120) (450 EUR)

Asking my friends, they even went beyond, sitting on a [Herman Miller Aeron](https://www.hermanmiller.com/de_de/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chair/) [1000+ EUR]

Now I am stuck in the awkward situation where I like my current chair, but I know there is a world beyond. To be clear, this is not about the money but about the ergonomics and the comfort. One of the lessons I learned in life is that I should not save money on things I use a lot (shoes, bed, toothbrush, keyboard), and a chair where I spent way too much time sitting on also falls into this category.
