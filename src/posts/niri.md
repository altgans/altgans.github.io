> It is autumn, I sit in the cozy warmth of my apartment and I read about [Niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45461500). _This is it!_, I shout. _The holy grail of window management! Finally!_.

In this blog I will describe my journey to set up Niri on my Linux laptop. I do so to enhance my understanding via [Socratic questioning and Feynman techique](./socratic-questioning)
Questions:
 
- What is a Window Manager (WM)?
- What flavors of WMs are there?
- What is Niri?
- What makes Niri special?
- What alternatives are there to Niri?
- What is Wayland?
- How does the Wayland ecosystem look?
- What is Quickshell?
