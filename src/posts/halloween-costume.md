Lessons learned:

Buy it early.

Don't just wear random blood in your face -- people will ask you if you are hurt.

Ensure that you are comfortable and warm, as (at least in Berlin), you may stand in the queue before a club for some time.

If wearing a robe, ensure that it does not drop down to the floor (really annoying when peeing/washing your hands/walking through the rain and puddles).

If wearing a mask, ensure you can breathe (and if wearing glasses, that the glasses don't fog).

Wear your costume with pride -- put it on before leaving the house.
I usually need some time to get into the 'party' mood, and wearing the costume early helps a lot.
In fact, this Halloween I started very shy, not daring to put on my robe+mask at all.
But as soon as I had everything on I loved it so much, I even wore the costume the day after, scaring a few people 😁.
